Citra is an experimental open-source Nintendo 3DS emulator/debugger written in C++. It is written with portability in mind, with builds actively maintained for Windows, Linux and macOS.

Citra emulates a subset of 3DS hardware and therefore is useful for running/debugging homebrew applications, and it is also able to run many commercial games! Some of these do not run at a playable state, but we are working every day to advance the project forward. (Playable here means compatibility of at least "Okay" on our [game compatibility list](https://citra-emu.org/game).)

Citra is licensed under the GPLv2 (or any later version). Refer to the license.txt file included. Please read the [FAQ](https://citra-emu.org/wiki/faq) before getting started with the project.

For development discussion, please join us on our [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Discord-7289da)](https://citra-emu.org/discord) server or at <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=citra-dev" alt="Freenode: #citra-dev"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/IRC%20channel-%23citra&hyphen;dev-23dd2e44.svg"></a>.

### Development

Most of the development happens on GitHub. It's also where [our central repository](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra) is hosted.

If you want to contribute please take a look at the [Contributor's Guide](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/wiki/Contributing) and [Developer Information](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/wiki/Developer-Information). You should also contact any of the developers in the forum in order to know about the current state of the emulator because the [TODO list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SWIop0uBI9IW8VGg97TAtoT_CHNoP42FzYmvG1F4QDA) isn't maintained anymore.

If you want to contribute to the user interface translation, please checkout citra project on [![Transifex](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Transifex-006f9f)](https://www.transifex.com/citra/citra). We centralize the translation work there, and periodically upstream translation.
